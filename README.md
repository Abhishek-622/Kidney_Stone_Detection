# Kidney_Stone_Detection
Kidney Stone Detection using CNN
Overview:
This project aims to detect kidney stones from medical images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an accuracy of 98%. The CNN model is trained and tested on a dataset of annotated medical images, such as CT scans or ultrasound images.

Features:
High accuracy (98%) in detecting kidney stones.
Automated analysis of medical images.
Potential for aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of high-resolution medical images (CT scans) with annotations indicating the presence of kidney stones.
